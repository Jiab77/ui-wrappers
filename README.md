## Features

Here is the actual features included in the project:

1. `browserSafeCheck()`: Verify if running from a static file.
2. `createToast(message, type)`: Create a notification toast.
3. `escapeHtml()`: Escape `HTML` string. ([Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46685127))
4. `readFile(file, callback)`: [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) wrapper, read file and execute given callback.
5. `updateFileSize(fileList, display)`: Take a [FileList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) as input and convert file size in bytes to human sizes.

## Documentation

Unfortunately, nothing has been written for now and you will have to read the code to learn how to use the functions.

By chance, they are pretty easy to read and use.
